				<p>
					Hello!  Thank you for taking the time to view my very first website which I created from scratch.  I am an aspiring full-stack developer trying to attain my certificate of completion from the Northwestern Coding Bootcamp.  I was born in Taiwan and grew up in Toronto and Michigan.  I attained my B.A in Political Science and Economics from the University of Michigan - Ann Arbor and received my M.B.A from the University of Texas at Austin - McCombs School of Business.  I have been a Web/Mobile Applications Product Manager for the last 10 years.
				</p>

				<p>
					In my personal time I enjoy travelling and being out in nature.  I am an avid backpacker.  My most recent adventure was taking 2 weeks to hike the Walker Haute Route from Mont Blanc France to Zermatt Switzerland. Other notable backpacking/camping trips was taking 6 weeks to hike/camp the Rocky Mountains from Grand Teton National Park to Jasper National Park in Canada.
